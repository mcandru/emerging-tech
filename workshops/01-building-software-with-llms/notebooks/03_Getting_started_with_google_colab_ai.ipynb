We are launching public preview for a simple and intuitive Python library (google.colab.ai) to access state-of-the-art language models directly within Colab environments. All users have free access to most popular LLMs, while paid users have access to a wider selection of models. This means users can spend less time on configuration and set up and more time bringing their ideas to life. With just a few lines of code, you can now perform a variety of tasks:\n",

            "They weren't the rustle of leaves in the wind, not exactly. They were softer, a constant, low murmur that seemed to shift with the light. Sometimes it sounded like a forgotten lullaby, sometimes a hushed argument, sometimes a ripple of laughter like scattered pearls. Elara would spend hours tucked inside its leafy curtain, her back pressed against its gnarled trunk, trying to decipher the sounds.\n",
            "\n",
            "One particularly grey afternoon, feeling lonely and out of place after a move to a new town, Elara sought refuge in her leafy sanctuary. The whispers seemed clearer today, tinged with a familiar sadness that mirrored her own. She closed her eyes, letting the sounds wash over her.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, a distinct voice, clear as a bell but soft as a sigh, seemed to separate from the chorus. It wasn't speaking words, not really, but conveying a feeling: *loss… comfort… hope… endure.*\n",
            "\n",
            "Elara gasped, her eyes flying open. She pressed her ear harder against the bark. The whispers coalesced, not into sentences, but into a tapestry of emotions, memories, and unspoken truths. The willow wasn't just a tree; it was a living archive. It had absorbed the joys, sorrows, secrets, and dreams of every person who had ever sought solace beneath its boughs.\n",
            "\n",
            "She heard the echoes of young lovers sharing their first kiss, the hushed tears of a child who had lost a pet, the silent prayers of an elderly woman, the excited plans of adventurers. The willow was holding onto all of it, a gentle keeper of human experience, constantly whispering the stories of the past into the present.\n",
            "\n",
            "A profound sense of peace settled over Elara. She wasn't alone. No one ever truly was, as long as there were places like this, silent witnesses to the human heart. She smiled, a genuine, unburdened smile.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Thank you,\" she whispered back to the tree, her voice swallowed by the endless, comforting hum. The willow, in return, seemed to embrace her with its soft, swaying branches, a timeless confidante in a constantly changing world. Elara knew then that she had found not just a friend, but a home for her own untold stories."
